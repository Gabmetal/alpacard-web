          # If the build doesn't require connecting to the DB, DATABASE_URL might be fakeable or skipPrisma.
          # However, `prisma generate` is in the build script, which usually doesn't need DB connection,
          # but `prisma db push` won't run here.
          # Let's assume standard build needs public keys at least.
